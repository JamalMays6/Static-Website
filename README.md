## 🔎 Case Study: Rise Up Bank Migrates to Azure Blob Storage
### Description
This guide walks you through setting up a static website using Azure Blob Storage. You’ll create a Storage Account via the Azure Portal, enable static website hosting, and upload an index.html file to the special $web container. No coding knowledge is required, as the necessary HTML and CSS files are provided. Finally, you’ll verify the website’s accessibility using the Azure Blob Storage endpoint in a private or incognito browser.

### Background

Rise Up Bank, a fintech startup, relies heavily on its website to attract, inform, and onboard clients. The company previously hosted its site on on-premises infrastructure, but growing maintenance costs and poor scalability led to operational inefficiencies.

#### What is Azure Blob Storage? 
Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. It’s optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, like text or binary data. You can use it to store files, backups, logs, and host static websites, similar to AWS S3.

#### Challenge ⚠️
Currently, Rise Up Bank’s website is hosted on traditional on-prem servers. Every week, the IT team found themselves bogged down by patches, maintenance, and emergency restarts. Whenever customer traffic spiked, especially during promotions, the site slowed down or crashed. Instead of focusing on new features or improving user experience, the team spent most of their time just trying to keep the lights on.

#### Solution ✅
To break free from the limitations of on-prem hosting, Rise Up Bank made the move to Azure. Instead of managing hardware and patching servers, they turned on Static Website Hosting in Azure Blob Storage. Suddenly, traffic surges were no longer a problem—Azure scaled with them automatically. By connecting to Azure CDN, users across the country saw faster load times. And with built-in encryption and role-based access, the site stayed locked down and secure.

#### Outcome 🏁 
After switching to Azure Blob Storage, Rise Up Bank finally found stability. The website loaded faster, scaled effortlessly during traffic spikes, and stayed online around the clock. Customers noticed the difference, and so did the IT team. With infrastructure worries out of the way, they could now focus on what really mattered, building better features and delivering smarter, safer banking.
